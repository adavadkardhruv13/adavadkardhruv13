## 🧑‍💻 About Me

```yaml
I'm a backend developer who loves solving real-world problems with smart, scalable systems.  
Whether it's preventing financial fraud in real-time or building emergency tech that saves lives —  
I turn complex ideas into resilient backend architectures.

🔧 What I Work On
- 🧠 Build intelligent systems with memory, logic, and context-awareness  
- 🧩 Craft scalable APIs using Django, FastAPI, and async workflows  
- 🧰 Integrate AI models to make backends think — not just respond  
- ⚙️ Automate everything from background tasks to system alerts  
- 📊 Data-driven, but product-first — I choose tools that solve problems, not just sound cool
